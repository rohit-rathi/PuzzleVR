How did you feel about the speed of the movement? Did it feel fast/slow?

"The initial movement felt perfect. But moving from inside the dungeon to the end point was too quick and made me feel a little sick. I would prefer if they were both the same speed as the initial movement speed."

Would you describe yourself feeling sick in anyway?

"I felt a little discomfort when moving from inside the dungeon to the end."

Lastly, Did you notice any height changes or anything disorienting in the movement?

"I think I stopped too early in the dungeon and that I could have stopped a little more inside. I am right on the edge of the door and I feel like I could fall."
